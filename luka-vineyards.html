            <p class="hero__subtitle">From yacht building to winemaking, the Harveys found their beautiful interruption</p>
        </div>
    </header>

    <article class="article">
        <p class="article__lead">
            The view from Luka Vineyards stretches across rows of Sauvignon Blanc vines to the distant silhouettes of elephants moving through the Knysna Elephant Park next door. It is not the typical backdrop for a wine estate. But then, nothing about Philip and Laura Harvey's journey to viticulture has been typical.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Harveys met in their early twenties and fell in love, not just with each other but with adventure. Philip built yachts in Knysna, crafting vessels that would carry people across oceans. Laura worked alongside him. Together, they raised children who grew up knowing that life was meant to be lived with purpose and passion.
        </p>

        <p>
            When they sold the yacht business, the question became: what next? The couple embarked on an epic food and wine journey around the world, a deliberate exploration of flavours, cultures, and possibilities. They returned to South Africa with a deeper appreciation for sustainable living and a nascent idea about their next chapter.
        </p>

        </figure>

        <div class="article__quote">
            <blockquote>
                "We figured boat building must be the most challenging of professions. How hard can owning a vineyard be?"
            </blockquote>
            <cite>— Laura Harvey</cite>
        </div>

        <h2>Finding Luka</h2>

        <p>
            In 2019, the Harveys purchased a seven-hectare property in Harkerville, the forested area between Knysna and Plettenberg Bay. The previous owners had kept the estate largely private, with occasional wine tastings but no real public presence. Philip and Laura saw something more: a venue, a gathering place, a continuation of their story.
        </p>

        <p>
            They named it Luka Vineyards and designed a mandala logo that tells their story through imagery, every element carrying a connection or emotion. Sailing across the ocean had brought them here; that journey now shapes how they think about sustainability, community, and what it means to put down roots after a life of movement.
        </p>

        <p>
            Opening a restaurant in 2020, during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic, required the same resilience that boat building had taught them. The outdoor-focused venue suited the restrictions of the time, and local support from Plettenberg Bay and Knysna carried them through. The location, perfectly positioned between the two towns, became an asset: a meeting point for friends who did not want to drive all the way to either.
        </p>

        <h2>The Wine</h2>

        <p>
            Luka's 1.5 hectares under vine produce Sauvignon Blanc, the grape that thrives in the Plettenberg Bay terroir. The region was granted Wine of Origin status in 2006 and has since developed a reputation for exceptional cool-climate whites. Some have called it the future "Champagne District" of South Africa, a nod to the quality of its Méthode Cap Classique sparkling wines.
        </p>

        <p>
            The vinification and bottling happen at Bramon Wine Estate, under the supervision of cellarmaster Anton Smal, known for his work at the acclaimed Villiera estate. Anton brings expertise and enthusiasm for the diversity of flavours that Harkerville's terroir, climate, and careful cultivation can produce.
        </p>

            <div class="wine-box__grid">
                <div class="wine-box__item">
                    <h4>Sauvignon Blanc</h4>
                    <p>Luka's flagship, a cool-climate expression of the Plett terroir. Crisp, elegant, and award-winning, including Silver at the International Michelangelo Awards and Double Gold at Vitis Vinifera 2013.</p>

        <h2>The Experience</h2>

            <figcaption>Relaxed wine tasting with views across the vineyard to the mountains beyond</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Luka Vineyards is less white tablecloth and more "come as you are," to use Laura's phrase. The café, presided over by Chef Richie, serves breakfast and lunch with an emphasis on local, seasonal ingredients. The menu changes regularly, promising that no two visits are quite the same.
        </p>

        <p>
            Signature dishes have earned devoted followings: the wood-fired pizzas, the "bazooka" ribs from the annual Chilli Festival, the sticky pork that regulars drive from Knysna specifically to order. Gluten-free cakes cater to dietary requirements, while vegan and vegetarian options ensure everyone finds something to love.
        </p>

        <p>
            The setting does most of the work. Tables overlook the vineyard and the dam, with elephants and zebras from the neighbouring sanctuary often visible in the middle distance. On winter days, fires crackle inside; in good weather, the terrace fills with families, couples, and groups of friends lingering over long lunches.

        <h2>A Philosophy of Care</h2>

        <p>
            The Harveys' sailing background informs how they think about their land. Sailors, by necessity, learn to work with what they have, to minimise waste, to respect the systems that sustain them. At Luka, this translates into a commitment to biodynamic practices and sustainable agriculture.
        </p>

        <p>
            They describe themselves as custodians rather than owners, a distinction that shapes decisions about everything from vineyard management to menu sourcing. Local suppliers are preferred. Seasonal ingredients dictate what appears on plates. The goal is not just to make good wine and serve good food, but to do so in a way that can continue indefinitely.
        </p>

        <h2>The Family Table</h2>

        <p>
            Luka welcomes life's celebrations. The venue hosts weddings, family gatherings, and milestone events, with a "Family Table" that seats ten for more intimate occasions. Children have space to play while parents relax; dogs are welcome on leads in outdoor areas.
        </p>

        <p>
            For Philip and Laura, this is the point. After years of building boats that would carry people to adventures elsewhere, they have created a place where adventure comes to them. The stories now happen here: proposals over sunset glasses of Sauvignon Blanc, birthday lunches with three generations around the table, friendships renewed over platters and wine.
        </p>

        <p>
            Luka Vineyards is a beautiful interruption, to use their phrase. A place to pause on the journey between Knysna and Plettenberg Bay, between one phase of life and the next. A vineyard built by people who understand that the best destinations are the ones where you want to linger.
